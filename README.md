# Axis Language

This repository is currently being restructured as part of an ongoing redesign
of the Axis language and its supporting tooling.

The earlier experimental code and research notes have been archived as the
project moves into the next phase of development. Updated material will appear
here once the new architecture is finalized.

For now, this repository serves as a placeholder while work continues in
private development branches.
